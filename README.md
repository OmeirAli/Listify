Listify is the ultimate solution for your daily to-do list and task reminders. With Listify, you can easily add a task and project name, set its due deadline date and time using the Calendar widget and time selector, and set your task’s priority with Listify’s easy-to-use interface. Once you’ve added your task, you can simply hit “Add Task” and watch it get added to your to-do list.

But that's not all! Listify also offers a host of additional features to make your life easier. For example, the app includes an edit task feature, as well as a bulk delete task feature, making it simple to manage your tasks and keep your list up-to-date.

In addition, Listify allows you to export your tasks to Excel and also import tasks from Excel. All you need to do is set the following headers on your Excel file: “Task”, “Project”, “Deadline”, and “Priority”. You don’t even need to add “Task Due In” in the header, as Listify will automatically calculate the time left until your task deadline hits and set reminders for you. Moreover, you can enter the date and time in any format you want in the "Deadline" column and Listify will read it and set reminders for it.

You can also use the find feature in Listify to search for tasks by “Task”, “Project”, “Deadline”, “Priority”, or “Task Due In”. Additionally, Listify’s quick edit feature allows you to edit your posted tasks quickly and easily.

Not only is Listify easy to use, it’s also elegant and beautiful. With its simple design, you can focus on getting your work done, without any unnecessary distractions. And if you need any help getting started, the app includes a full help/tutorial video in the bottom right-hand corner of the UI.
